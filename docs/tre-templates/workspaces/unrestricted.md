# Unrestricted workspace

The unrestricted workspace template is a workspace template that allows for unrestricted access to the Internet from inside the workspace virtual network. This is useful for working on open data sets where data exfiltration is not a concern.

This workspace template builds upon the base workspace template by adding additional firewall rules and disabling the airlock.
